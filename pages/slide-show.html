        TODO to finish this page:
            Make it "slide" with JS. May have to have an img tag instead of
                using a background.
            Load an image/recipe index.
            Load displayed recipe when the center container is clicked.
        TODO if there is time:
            Add index-based controls for slideshow
            Make it prettier!
